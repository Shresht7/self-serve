# `self-serve`

A super simple static file server.

## üåü Features

- **Static File Server**: Serve up a directory and its files
- **Live Refresh**: Automatically refreshes the browser when you change a web file
- **CSS Hot Swap**: CSS changes are injected directly without a full-page reload for a seamless styling experience
- **Directory Listing**: Generates and displays a list of contents, If a directory doesn't have an `index.html`
- **SPA Mode**: Fallback to `index.html` for single-page applications
- **API Routes**: Create server-side API endpoints
- **Zero-Dependency**: Zero external dependencies (other than the standard library)

## üìã Usage

If you have Deno, you can run `self-serve.ts` with:

```sh
deno run --allow-net --allow-read self-serve.ts
```

you can also directly run the `self-serve.ts` from the web without installing or cloning the repository.

```sh
deno run --allow-net --allow-read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shresht7/self-serve/refs/heads/main/self-serve.ts
```

Alternatively, you can install `self-serve` as a cli application using [`deno install`](#-installation) and run it locally using:

```sh
self-serve
```

This starts the server on `localhost:5327`

to specify the `port`

```sh
deno run --allow-net --allow-read self-serve.ts --port 3000
```

to enable SPA mode

```sh
deno run --allow-net --allow-read self-serve.ts --spa
```

to specify the api directory

```sh
deno run --allow-net --allow-read self-serve.ts --api api
```

### Arguments

## üì¶ Installation

To compile and install it as a binary

```sh
deno install --global --allow-net --allow-read --config deno.json self-serve.ts --name self-serve

## üõ∞Ô∏è API Routes

`self-serve` supports creating server-side API endpoints. To enable this feature, use the `--api` flag and specify the directory where your API files are located. By default, it looks for an `api/` directory in your project's root.

### Creating API Endpoints

To create an API endpoint, you create a `.ts` or `.js` file inside your designated API directory. The name of the file will determine the API route.

For example, a file named `hello.ts` in the `api/` directory will create an endpoint at `/api/hello`.

### Handling HTTP Methods

Inside your API file, you can export functions that correspond to the HTTP methods you want to handle (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.). These functions will receive the `Request` object as an argument and should return a `Response` object.

Here is an example of a simple API endpoint that handles `GET` and `POST` requests:

**`api/hello.ts`**

```ts
export function GET(req: Request): Response {
    return new Response("Hello from API!")
}

export function POST(req: Request): Response {
    return new Response("You posted to me!")
}
```

Now, if you run `self-serve --api api`, you can make requests to `/api/hello`:

- `GET /api/hello` will return `Hello from API!`
- `POST /api/hello` will return `You posted to me!`

### Nested Routes

You can also create nested routes by creating subdirectories inside your API directory. For example, a file named `api/users/profile.ts` will create an endpoint at `/api/users/profile`.

## ‚öΩ Goals

I had very specific goals and self-imposed challenges in mind when building this project.

- Quickly spin up a simple static file server
- Self-contained in a single file (No longer the case, but was fun trying to cram everything into one file)
- No external dependencies, use only the standard library
- Just good enough for basic web development
- Optionally support live-reloading and directory listing
- Be half-decent

## üèõÔ∏è Go Version

This repository also contains a Go implementation (`./static/go/main.go`) which was the original. It is a very basic file-server and **does not** include features like live-reloading. It is preserved here as one of the main goals of this project, for me, was to build a static file server as concisely as possible in a single file.
